NOTE: This document is under construction

== Rules

=== General

- Libraries, registry and services are pre-deployed on the chain (by Etherisc) and are owned by the protocol owner
- Registry access is granted through the `RegistryAccessManager`
- Transactional operations (writing) to the registry are done via the `RegistryService`
- Services and registry are maintained and upgraded by the protocol owner

=== Instance

- New instances are created by the instancer owner calling `InstanceService.createInstanceClone`
- Transactional operations (writing) are only via services
- Read access to the instance is done through the `InstanceReader` and/or services
- Every instance has its own `AuthorizationManager` for managing authorizations
- Authorization is managed by the instance owner
- GIF provides default set of authorizations when cloning the instance

=== Component

- Components are built and deployed by the component owners (which are not the same as the protocol owner)
- Components interact with the instance through the services
- Components are bound to a fixed major version of a service
- End users (consumers) interact with the system through components
- Components must provide all necessary functions for consumer interaction 
- Components use the instance's `AuthorizationManager` for authorization checks
