     * [IMPORTANT]
     * ====
     * In general, this modifier should only be used on `external` functions. It is okay to use it on `public`
     * functions that are used as external entry points and are not called internally. Unless you know what you're
     * doing, it should never be used on `internal` functions. Failure to follow these rules can have critical security
     * implications! This is because the permissions are determined by the function that entered the contract, i.e. the
     * function at the bottom of the call stack, and not the function where the modifier is visible in the source code.
     * ====
     *
     * [WARNING]
     * ====
     * Avoid adding this modifier to the https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/contracts.html#receive-ether-function[`receive()`]
     * function or the https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/contracts.html#fallback-function[`fallback()`]. These
     * functions are the only execution paths where a function selector cannot be unambiguosly determined from the calldata
     * since the selector defaults to `0x00000000` in the `receive()` function and similarly in the `fallback()` function
     * if no calldata is provided. (See {_checkCanCall}).
     *
     * The `receive()` function will always panic whereas the `fallback()` may panic depending on the calldata length.
