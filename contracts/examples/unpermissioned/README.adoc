= Unpermissioned example components

This directory contains a set of unpermissioned example compoents that are mainly used for testing purposes.
The expose all the available functions of the component without requiring any permissions (and thereby setup) to use them. 

Components that are built in such a way should never be used in production, as they expose functions that can move tokens or other assets without any authorization.
