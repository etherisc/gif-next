## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [our documentation](https://docs.etherisc.com/). 

Most of our code in written in [Solidy](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/). 
Our documentation is mainly written in [AsciiDoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/) and will be compiled automatically to HTML once the change has been commited on the _develop_ branch. The are some minor documents written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with our code or the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/etherisc/gif-next/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/etherisc/gif-next/issues) to find one that interests you. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

How to get an development environment set up on your local machine see [here](https://docs.etherisc.com/sandbox/setup). This is the documentation for the old sandbox environment, please note that the gif-next works similar, but not identical and it will not (yet) automatically deploy an instance on container startup. If you have question, please contact us on Discord. 
Once you are ready **create a working branch and start with your changes!**

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. 

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Please make sure you have read and signed our CLA (contributor license agreement) before you submit your first PR. You can sign the CLA by adding a comment to the PR with the following text: `I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA`. Our CLA assistant will add comment to your PR as soon as you open it in case you have not signed yet.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
